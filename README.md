## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid
- Responsive Design
- Custom gradient text animation


### What I learned

I learned the basics of Grid and how to use better Figma to import styles and color properties, like the gradient text I used in this challenge. I also started to use webp images and the picture tag instead of import the different image sizes directly from the CSS.
